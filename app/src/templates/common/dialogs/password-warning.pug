                    | The SelfKey Identity Wallet protects your wallet with a password.
                    | You must remember this password to unlock the wallet.
                    | There is no way it can be restored or reset.
                    | As the wallet is stored locally in your device,
                    | SelfKey does not have access and therefore cannot help you if the password is lost.
